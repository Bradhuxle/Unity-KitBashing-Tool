# Unity-Prefab-to-OBJ-Exporter-Tool
OBJ Exporter for Unity — No Blender Needed!

If you’re a lazy bum (like most of us 😏) and don’t want to spend hours learning Blender — this tool’s got you covered.

This Unity Editor script lets you instantly convert any selected GameObject or group of objects into a complete 3D model with materials, textures, and images included. Combine models, export them as a single mesh, and get a clean .obj + .mtl setup with zero hassle.

Whether you’re kitbashing assets, remixing downloaded models, or just need a quick export for Blender or other 3D tools — this script makes it effortless.

Features:

Exports full .obj and .mtl files

Automatically includes textures and materials

Works with single or grouped objects

One-click export from the Unity Editor

Usage:
Select your object → go to Tools > Export Selected to OBJ (With Materials) → choose a save location → done.

💡 No need to open Blender, deal with UV maps, or touch complex export settings — just select, export, and vibe.
